# tailwind-starter-template
A quick start project for getting setup with plain HTML + CSS with Tailwind CSS

## To get setup:
Install dependencies
```npm install```

Run the project
```npm run dev```

Build the project for prod
```npm run prod```

The **public** directory is where the fully-built website lives. 
If you want to quickly deploy the website on Netlify, simply [drag and drop that directory into a new site](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#drag-and-drop).
